      <description>Overview GeekSalon is a programming community for university students to complete the planning, development, and release of an app in three months. Assuming a fictional trial event of this GeekSalon for female students, I designed a landing page as a design assignment with receiving feedback from seniors. However, when I proposed the design to the GeekSalon team, we decided to realize the event in autumn 2019 expecting to create new value and synergy.</description>

      <description>Overview MANOMA is a new smart home service provided by SONY. Our company sells it targeting 20â€™s. I designed a flyer as product descriptions used in face-to-face sales. I made it as my first design job with learning Illustrator and Photoshop. The reason why I came to design this flyer is because their original flyer did not have a hierarchy. We solved it by emphasizing the message &amp;ldquo;Switch easily at the low price&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Background I started customizing HTML/CSS at 12 years old for my diary blog. However, since I was too eager in it, my mom took the laptop away from me soon. Since then, I had not touched a computer.
Meanwhile, I was dreaming to live abroad because I only grew up in a small town in Japan with seeing other cultures through media but no chance to travel. Finally, I made it to NewZealand and Australia for a long stay at 19 after saving up.</description>
