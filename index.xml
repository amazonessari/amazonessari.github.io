      <description>Before internship I have been into creativity in my entire life. When I was a little kid I used try to make anything from trash such as UFO catcher, a scale model and furniture.
It comes to aesthetics when to create anything. Beautiful stuffs attract me a lot, but I thought it is a natural born talent and there is nothing I can do. However I had a chance to learn design as an intern through my friend.</description>
